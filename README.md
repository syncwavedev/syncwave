We built Syncwave because we were tired of project management tools that get in your way. As developers ourselves, we wanted something that feels familiar (like our IDEs) but keeps things simple with a kanban approach. No unnecessary features, no clutterâ€”just a fast, collaborative tool that lets you focus on building great software. We've stripped away all the distractions to create something we actually enjoy using ourselves.

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) powers our backend.
- [SQLite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite) is the default storage for our self-hosted offering.
- [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb) is the storage used by [app.syncwave.dev](https://app.syncwave.dev).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) makes the UI beautiful.
- [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) is the build tool for our static (landing, docs).
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - the whole app is written in TypeScript.
